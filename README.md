# Horiseon Website Mock-Up

## Project Goal

Horiseon approached us with the goal in mind to refactor their website in order to meet certain standards.

The ADA, also known as the Americans with Disabilities Act, requires companies to abide by certain laws in order to help prevent discrimination against those with disabilities. Horiseon strives to be WCAG compliant, thus increasing the accessibility of their website was our goal.

Accessibility ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies like video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards.

I learned that there is much HTML/CSS code that is required in order to make a website more accessible. It is something that is often overlooked and not thought about by those who don't have hearing/vision impairments.

## Table of Contents (Optional)

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license)

## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

## Usage

md ![alt text] (C:\Users\brown\git\homeworks\01_homework\assets\images\screen capture.png)

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.
If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.
If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

## The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
